            <small>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don’t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of LYou have bought the most gorgeous tiles and are all set to get the floor of your dreams. Pause and count to ten. Getting the floor tiles installed correctly is as important as choosing the right tile, because a shoddy job can mar the beauty of your very expensive tiles. Premium-quality tiles, along with correct application techniques and good workmanship, create floors that last. A good tile contractor is essential to ensure that the installation is done smoothly and skillfully. Here are some tips about things to look out for.</small><br></br><br></br>
            <small><span className='text-bold' style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>1. Check the tiles</span><br></br><br></br>
Before the tile installation starts, check the tiles for any kind of damage, discolouration or shade difference. Change the defective tiles immediately. Make sure that the contractor handles the tiles carefully to avoid any kind of damage.</small><br></br><br></br>
            <small><span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Note:</span><br></br> During tile installation, there is wastage when cutting tiles for the periphery of the floor. There might not be enough space for a full tile, so the tiles have to be cut to fit in. It is important to order at least 10 per cent extra tiles to accommodate for this wastage.</small><br></br><br></br>
            <small>Additionally, keep one or two boxes of spare tiles in stock after the installation of the flooring, so that if there is any damage in the future, you have the exact tiles for replacement.</small><br></br><br></br>
            <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>2. Ensure proper surface preparation</span><br></br><br></br>
            <small>Have the floor repaired and levelled to achieve a smooth surface for sticking on the tiles.</small><br></br>
            <small>Make sure that the surface is clean, dry and dust-free. There should be no loose material (like hardened cement granules) around.</small><br></br>
            <small>Get the walls chipped up to a height of 4-6 inches (as per requirement) from the floor for installing the skirting tiles.</small><br></br><br></br>
            <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>3. Decide on the floor pattern</span><br></br><br></br>
            <small>If you plan to mix and match two or three types of tiles, as in this image, it is essential to prepare the tiling layout on paper. Let the tiling contractor plan the layout of these tiles beforehand so as to avoid mistakes during the final tile installation.</small><br></br>
            <small>When installing tiles of a uniform design – for example, when you are laying the same kind of vitrified tiles throughout the home – make sure that the contractor lays the tiles in such a way that a minimum of tiles are cut and wasted.</small><br></br><br></br>
            <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>4. Check the tile installation process</span><br></br><br></br>
            <small>Make sure that the tiles are soaked in water for at least 30 minutes. Note that if adhesive is applied onto a dry tile, then the dry tile might might absorb all the moisture from the adhesive, resulting in weak tile adherence.</small><br></br>
            <small>Check that the contractor mixes only a limited quantity of adhesive with water, as much as will be used within 30 minutes, so as to avoid wastage.</small><br></br>
            <small>The contractor should maintain a gap of 1-2 millimetres between the tiles for grouting, or, alternatively, install spacers between the tiles to maintain an equal gap between each tile.</small><br></br>
            <small>Ensure that the contractor installs the skirting, only after installing the floor tiles so as to be able to close the gaps that may be present between the floor tiles and the wall.</small><br></br><br></br>
            <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>5. Give adequate setting time</span><br></br><br></br>
            <small>The contractor should apply the grout only after the tile adhesive has hardened for at least 24 hours.</small><br></br>
            <small>Also, do not let anyone to walk on the freshly laid tiles for 24 hours.</small><br></br><br></br>
            <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>6. Complete the grouting</span><br></br><br></br>
            <small>Before the contractor applies the grout, check and make sure that the colour of the grout matches with the tile colour.</small><br></br><br></br>
            <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>7. Clean the tiles</span><br></br><br></br>
            <small>Once the grout is set, see to it that the contractor uses a moist cloth or a sponge dipped in diluted soap solution or water to clean the tiles of any haze or residue that may have been left behind by the grout.</small><br></br><br></br>
            <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Note:</span><small>The contractor should not use of any kind of acid cleaners or strong soap-based cleaners that may damage the tiles.</small><br></br><br></br>
            <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>8. Finally, check the tile installation</span><br></br><br></br>
            <small>This can be checked by tapping the tiles – a hollow sound indicates that the tile has detached from the base floor or tile adhesive. If you find any such defect, ask the contractor to reinstall those tiles immediately.</small>
